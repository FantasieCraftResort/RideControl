## Reason for development
While working with multiple redstone systems, I've come to the conclusion that there are lots of missing nieche features in the current state of minecraft plugins. That's why I'd like to add these features.

## Design Strategy
This plugin will use the [default logic gate structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate) found in many industrial control systems, i.e. [PLCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller).

## Why this plugin?
- Control rides without any redstone
- No need for complex circuitry
- Built from the ground up to support [TrainCarts](https://github.com/bergerhealer/TrainCarts)
- Make realism more accessible
